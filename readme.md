## Introduction

pipeline is an open-source Python library for TODO

pipeline is released under the GPL v3 license.

## Install

pipeline requires python 3 and can be installed by navigating to the directory containing the package and running the following command::

  $ pip install .

However we suggest using an isolated environment. A good option is to use
`Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__  ( make sure to install the
Python 3 version), which has extensive documentation.

From a clean install the following command will install everything you need. It should be entered into the terminal (located in the pipeline directory)::

  $ pip install . -r requirements.txt

NB: This will soon be much simpler once a version of pipeline is uploaded to PyPi, please bear with us in the meantime.
