# SSPipeline : A pipeline for estimating and characterizing uncertainty in coastal storm surge levels

TODO

### Installation

Since this project is still in the development stage, we will not be pushing to PyPi as much as we would like to, so this way of installation might be a bit old:

```shell
pip install sspipeline
```

To get the bleeding edge version, download the repository and run `pip install .` in the repository's root folder.
 If you are using python 3.x, run `pip3 install .` instead. Note: this package depends on some requirements that don't come with Python, but you can install them via `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
