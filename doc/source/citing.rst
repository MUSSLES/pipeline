Citing SSPipeline
*****************

If SSPipeline has enabled significant parts of an academic publication, please acknowledge that by citing the software. At the moment, we are currently planning on submitting a paper to the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS), but until a specific publication is written about SSPipeline, please cite the GitHub URL: `www.github.com/MUSSLES/sspipeline <https://github.com/MUSSLES/sspipeline>`_.

Note: You can check out a draft of the paper that we will be submitting to JOSS `here <https://github.com/MUSSLES/sspipeline/blob/master/doc/joss_paper/paper.pdf>`_.
