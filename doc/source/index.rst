For a while now, sea-level rise has been gradually becoming a bigger and bigger deal. A lot of people often look at mean sea-levels to depict how much sea-levels are rising on average, but we wanted to look at extreme sea levels (a.k.a storm surges) over annual maxima blocks. This work is extremely helpful for determining how tall to build a levee. With our work, you can determine the return levels for your sea level dataset.

.. warning::

    The SSPipeline project is in early stages of development and there will be bugs.
    Many methods must be used with care and could be improved significantly. The
    developers take no responsibility for inappropriate application of the code
    or incorrect conclusions drawn as a result of their application. Users must
    take responsibility for ensuring results obtained are sensible. We hope that
    by releasing the code at this stage the community can move forward more quickly
    together.
