.. warning::

    The pipeline project is in early stages of development and there will be bugs.
    Many methods must be used with care and could be improved significantly. The
    developers take no responsibility for inappropriate application of the code
    or incorrect conclusions drawn as a result of their application. Users must
    take responsibility for ensuring results obtained are sensible. We hope that
    by releasing the code at this stage the community can move forward more quickly
    together.
